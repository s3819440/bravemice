							<h2>Summary:</h2>
							<p>With over 100 jobs in my 'career', and at 48 years old, I am the very definition of adaptable ... and grumpy. Raised in a tiny country town by 2 doctors, I look like the love child of a hobbit with gigantism that shagged a Wookie after a big night out at The Green Dragon. There's a good chance that if we ever get off this planet, I will become Galactic President one day, and given the opportunity, I will gladly colonise ( and terraform if necessary ) another planet, then quarantine it from the insanity of this one.</p>
							<p>I grew up with electronics around me, microscopes, the earliest home computers, and always had an interest in science and technology. Much of my work history has been technical in nature. but I am currently authoring a series of ( largely academic ) books in addition to my study, and I am interested in inventing all sorts of things &mdash; from software to conceptual or mechanical systems, devices, games, and even furniture.</p>
							<h2>Ideal job:</h2>
							<p>Aside from Galactic President ( which is really just a side hobby ), I have no ideal job &mdash; however, I am an author/writer, designer, inventor, and many other things ... so you could say my ideal job is working on my own projects, and being a consultant / contractor on the side.</p>
